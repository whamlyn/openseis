# OpenSeis

OpenSeis is a fairly preliminary Python package for storing and accessing seismic trace and header data (2D and/or 3D) more rapidly than if the are stored in SEG-Y format. This package primarily makes use of HDF5 format via the h5py package to both store and access trace data and trace headers.

This package is in very early stages and requirements and functionality are still very loosly defined.
