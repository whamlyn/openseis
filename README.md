#OpenSeis

OpenSeis is currently a fairly preliminary Python package for storing and accessing seismic (2D and/or 3D) datasets more rapidly and flexibly than if the data are stored in SEG-Y format. This package primarily makes use of the HDF5 format via the h5py package to both store and access trace data and trace headers.
